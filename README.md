## 🚀 Why Pill Time?
Most pill trackers are bloated with ads, require accounts, and track your behavior. **Pill Time** was built to be the opposite: **Safe, Simple, and Silent.**

* **⚡️ Offline First:** Works perfectly without an internet connection.
* **🔒 100% Private:** Your health data is stored securely on your device (SQLite). We have no servers.
* **🧠 AI Health Assistant:** Securely check side effects or interactions using a privacy-proxy AI chatbot.
* **📉 Smart Inventory:** Automatically tracks your stock and warns you before you run out.

## ✨ Features
* **Simple Scheduling:** Set daily or specific-day reminders in seconds.
* **Inventory Tracking:** "Took a pill? We subtracted it from the bottle."
* **Adherence History:** Visualize your consistency with beautiful charts.
* **Doctor Reports:** Export your logs to PDF for medical appointments.
* **Zero Ads:** Forever free and open source.

## 📥 How to Install (Android)
1.  Click the **Download APK** button above.
2.  Open the file on your phone.
3.  If prompted, allow "Install from Unknown Sources" (This is required for apps outside the Play Store).

## 🛡️ Privacy Policy
We believe your medical data belongs to you.
* We do not collect personal data.
* AI chats are processed via a secure proxy and never stored.
* [Read the full Privacy Policy here](PRIVACY.md).
